Vim Plugin PHPUnit

this plugin allows you run tests directly from vim

INSTALL
-------

just copy 'phpunit.vim' to your '$HOME/.vim/plugins' directry


USAGE
------

There are defined three commands

:PhpUnit [path]

run phpunit with path. Path is not manadatory. If Path is not defined it vim-phpunit use <g:phpunit_tests> variable

:PhpUnitSwitchFile

Open testfile for current file. Name of testfile is taken from curent path in following way:
<g:phpunit_testroot>/<current path>/<file name>Test.php
and vice versa for testing file (if you are on test file, it will open source file complementary to testfile)

version 0.1 doesn't care about path existence - it's your responsibility
(maybe in next version)

:PhpUnitFile

run phpunit for current file. There is heuristic like :PhpUnitSwitchFile
eg. 
[file] dir/file.php => [test] <g:phpunit_testroot>/dir/fileTest
[file] <g:phpunit_testroot>/dir/fileTest => [test] <g:phpunit_testroot>/dir/fileTest
